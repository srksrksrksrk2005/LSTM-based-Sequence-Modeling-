# LSTM with PyTorch

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network using **PyTorch**.

LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to model sequential and time-series data effectively by handling long-term dependencies.

The notebook demonstrates:

- Data preparation and preprocessing  
- Building an LSTM model in PyTorch  
- Training loop implementation  
- Loss computation and optimization  
- Model evaluation
